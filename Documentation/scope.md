# Scope
The scope of an online assessment system defines the boundaries of what the system will and will not include. Here's a breakdown of the scope of an online assessment system:

1. **Assessment Types**: Define the types of assessments that will be supported by the system. This could include quizzes, tests, exams, surveys, and self-assessments.

2. **User Roles and Permissions**: Identify the different user roles that will interact with the system, such as students, teachers, administrators, and possibly parents or guardians. Specify the permissions and capabilities associated with each role.

3. **Assessment Creation and Management**: Outline the functionality for creating and managing assessments. This includes features such as adding questions, setting time limits, specifying grading criteria, and organizing assessments into categories or courses.

4. **Question Types**: Specify the types of questions that the system will support, such as multiple choice, true/false, short answer, essay, and interactive questions (e.g., drag-and-drop, matching).

5. **User Registration and Authentication**: Define the process for users to register accounts, log in securely, and reset passwords if needed. Ensure compliance with data protection regulations and best practices for user privacy and security.

6. **Assessment Delivery**: Describe how assessments will be delivered to users. This could include options for online proctoring, timed assessments, randomization of questions, and support for multimedia content within questions.

7. **Scoring and Grading**: Specify how assessments will be scored and graded. This may involve automatic grading for objective questions (e.g., multiple choice) and manual grading for subjective questions (e.g., essays). Include support for partial credit and customizable grading rubrics.

8. **Feedback and Reporting**: Outline the feedback mechanisms available to users after completing assessments. This could include immediate feedback on correct/incorrect answers, detailed explanations for answers, and performance analytics to track progress over time.

9. **Accessibility and Usability**: Ensure that the system is accessible to users with disabilities and complies with accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG). Design the user interface to be intuitive and user-friendly, with support for multiple languages if necessary.

10. **Integration and Interoperability**: Identify any external systems or platforms that the assessment system will need to integrate with, such as learning management systems (LMS), student information systems (SIS), or third-party tools for content authoring or analytics.

11. **Support and Maintenance**: Define the level of support and maintenance that will be provided for the system post-implementation. This includes regular updates, bug fixes, technical support for users, and training for administrators.

12. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Address any legal and ethical considerations related to data privacy, security, copyright, and intellectual property rights. Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and guidelines governing online assessments.

By clearly defining the scope of the online assessment system, stakeholders can align their expectations, prioritize features and functionalities, and ensure successful project delivery within the specified constraints.
