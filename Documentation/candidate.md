## 🏢 How this looks in a real company demo

* Hiring Manager clicks **“View”** in CandidateTable
* Lands on **Candidate Profile**
* Already knows:

  * Strength areas
  * Risk areas
  * Interview focus points
* Interview becomes **validation**, not discovery


## 🚀 Natural Next Steps (Very Important)

I strongly recommend this exact order:

1. **Add React Router**

   * `/dashboard`
   * `/candidates`
   * `/candidate/:id`

2. **Pass candidate data via props / API**

3. **Interview Assist component**

4. **Mentor feedback & audit trail**

5. **Role-based views (HR vs Tech Lead)**


### Mentor Closing (Transflower Style)

> *“A resume tells a story.*
> *A profile like this shows the truth.”*

Tell me the next step:

* Routing?
* API integration?
* Interview Assist screen?
* Convert this into a **student learning lab**?

We’re building this exactly like a **real product team would**.
