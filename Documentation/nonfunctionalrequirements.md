# Non-functional requirements of TFL Assessment

Non-functional requirements for an online assessment system define the quality attributes, constraints, and criteria that impact the overall usability, performance, security, and maintainability of the system. Here's a breakdown of non-functional requirements for such a system:

### 1. Performance:
1. **Response Time**: The system should respond to user interactions (e.g., loading assessments, submitting responses) within an acceptable time frame (e.g., < 3 seconds).
2. **Scalability**: The system should be able to handle concurrent users and increasing loads without degradation in performance.
3. **Throughput**: The system should support a high volume of assessment transactions per unit of time (e.g., X assessments per hour).
4. **Availability**: The system should be available for use during specified uptime hours (e.g., 99.9% uptime).

### 2. Security:
5. **Data Encryption**: User data, including login credentials and assessment results, should be encrypted during transmission and storage.
6. **Authentication and Authorization**: The system should authenticate users securely and enforce role-based access control to restrict unauthorized access to assessments and sensitive data.
7. **Audit Logging**: Record and log all user activities and system events for accountability and traceability purposes.
8. **Protection Against Attacks**: Implement measures to protect the system against common security threats such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

### 3. Reliability:
9. **Fault Tolerance**: The system should be resilient to failures and recover gracefully from errors without data loss or service disruption.
10. **Data Integrity**: Ensure the integrity of assessment data by implementing mechanisms for data validation, error checking, and data consistency.
11. **Backup and Recovery**: Regularly back up assessment data and implement procedures for data recovery in case of system failures or disasters.

### 4. Usability:
12. **User Interface Design**: Design a user-friendly interface that is intuitive, visually appealing, and easy to navigate.
13. **Accessibility**: Ensure that the system is accessible to users with disabilities, complying with standards such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
14. **Multilingual Support**: Provide support for multiple languages to accommodate diverse user populations.

### 5. Compliance:
15. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards for data privacy (e.g., GDPR, FERPA), accessibility (e.g., WCAG), and security (e.g., ISO 27001).
16. **Legal Requirements**: Adhere to copyright and intellectual property laws when using third-party content in assessments.
17. **Ethical Considerations**: Address ethical considerations related to assessment design, administration, and data usage, ensuring fairness, transparency, and integrity.

### 6. Maintainability:
18. **Modularity**: Design the system with a modular architecture to facilitate maintenance, updates, and future enhancements.
19. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for system components, configurations, and procedures to support troubleshooting and system maintenance.
20. **Code Quality**: Maintain high code quality standards, including readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding best practices.

### 7. Interoperability:
21. **Integration**: Support interoperability with external systems such as Learning Management Systems (LMS), Student Information Systems (SIS), and third-party tools through standardized protocols and APIs.
22. **Data Exchange**: Enable seamless exchange of assessment data and metadata with other systems for reporting, analytics, and administrative purposes.

### 8. Performance Efficiency:
23. **Resource Utilization**: Optimize resource utilization (e.g., CPU, memory, storage) to minimize system overhead and maximize efficiency.
24. **Energy Efficiency**: Design the system to minimize energy consumption, particularly for server infrastructure and data centers.

These non-functional requirements ensure that the online assessment system meets the desired quality attributes and performs effectively across various dimensions, contributing to a positive user experience and reliable operation. Each requirement should be further refined and quantified with specific metrics and criteria to guide implementation, testing, and evaluation.
