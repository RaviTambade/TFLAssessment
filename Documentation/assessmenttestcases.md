# Testcases for TFL Assessment

When designing test cases for an online assessment system, it's crucial to ensure that the system functions correctly, securely, and efficiently. Here's a comprehensive set of test cases covering various aspects of an online assessment system:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Verify that users can register for an account.
   - Verify that registered users can log in successfully.
   - Verify that users cannot log in with invalid credentials.
   - Verify that users can reset their passwords if forgotten.
   - Verify that users receive appropriate error messages for failed authentication attempts.

2. **Assessment Creation and Management:**
   - Verify that authorized users can create new assessments.
   - Verify that assessments have proper titles, descriptions, and time limits.
   - Verify that questions can be added to assessments with correct types (e.g., multiple choice, short answer, essay).
   - Verify that questions can be edited, deleted, or reordered within an assessment.
   - Verify that assessments can be assigned to specific user groups or classes.

3. **Taking an Assessment:**
   - Verify that users can start and submit assessments within the specified time limits.
   - Verify that users cannot access assessments before the start time or after the end time.
   - Verify that assessments display questions in the correct order.
   - Verify that users can navigate between questions and review/change their answers.
   - Verify that assessments auto-submit if the time limit expires.

4. **Question Types:**
   - Verify that multiple-choice questions display answer options correctly.
   - Verify that users can select only one answer for single-choice questions.
   - Verify that users can select multiple answers for multiple-choice questions.
   - Verify that short answer questions accept valid responses and reject invalid ones.
   - Verify that essay questions allow users to input text of any length.
   - Verify that file upload questions accept the specified file types and sizes.

5. **Scoring and Feedback:**
   - Verify that assessments are automatically scored for multiple-choice and short-answer questions.
   - Verify that essay questions can be manually graded by instructors.
   - Verify that users receive immediate feedback on their performance after completing an assessment.
   - Verify that users can review their submitted assessments, including correct answers and explanations where applicable.

6. **Security:**
   - Verify that the system prevents unauthorized access to assessments and user data.
   - Verify that user sessions are securely managed, with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Verify that assessments are protected against cheating or tampering by users.
   - Verify that sensitive data (e.g., passwords, assessment answers) is stored securely and encrypted.

7. **Performance and Scalability:**
   - Verify that the system can handle multiple concurrent users taking assessments.
   - Verify that the system performs efficiently, with minimal latency and response times.
   - Verify that the system scales well as the number of users and assessments increases.

8. **Compatibility and Accessibility:**
   - Verify that the assessment system works correctly on different web browsers and devices (desktop, mobile, tablet).
   - Verify that the user interface is accessible to users with disabilities, adhering to accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).

9. **Localization:**
   - Verify that the assessment system supports multiple languages and locales.
   - Verify that all text, instructions, and error messages are correctly translated and displayed in the user's preferred language.

10. **Integration and API Testing:**
    - Verify that the assessment system integrates seamlessly with other systems (e.g., learning management systems, student information systems).
    - Verify that APIs for retrieving assessment data or results function correctly and return accurate responses.

11. **Backup and Recovery:**
    - Verify that the system regularly backs up assessment data to prevent data loss.
    - Verify that data can be restored from backups in case of system failures or disasters.

By thoroughly testing each of these areas, you can ensure that your online assessment system is robust, reliable, and capable of meeting the needs of both users and administrators. Additionally, consider automating test cases where possible to streamline the testing process and improve efficiency.
