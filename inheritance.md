# Interface inheritance and implementation inheritance

### Interface Inheritance:

Interface inheritance allows a class to inherit multiple interfaces, enabling it to define the behavior specified by those interfaces.

```csharp
// Interface definition
public interface IShape
{
    void Draw();
}

// Another interface
public interface IResizable
{
    void Resize(int width, int height);
}

// Class implementing both interfaces
public class Rectangle : IShape, IResizable
{
    public void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a rectangle.");
    }

    public void Resize(int width, int height)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Resizing the rectangle to {width}x{height}.");
    }
}

// Usage
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();
rect.Draw(); // Output: Drawing a rectangle.
rect.Resize(100, 200); // Output: Resizing the rectangle to 100x200.
```

In the above example, the `Rectangle` class implements both the `IShape` and `IResizable` interfaces, thus inheriting their contracts. It must provide implementations for all members defined by those interfaces.

### Implementation Inheritance:

Implementation inheritance refers to the inheritance of members and behavior from a base class by a derived class.

```csharp
// Base class
public class Animal
{
    public virtual void Sound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal makes a sound.");
    }
}

// Derived class inheriting from Animal
public class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Sound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barks.");
    }
}

// Usage
Dog dog = new Dog();
dog.Sound(); // Output: Dog barks.
```

In this example, the `Dog` class inherits the `Sound` method from the `Animal` base class. By overriding the `Sound` method in the `Dog` class, it provides a specialized implementation for the sound made by dogs.

### Combining Interface and Implementation Inheritance:

You can combine interface inheritance and implementation inheritance in a single class. This allows you to inherit both behavior and contracts from interfaces and base classes.

```csharp
// Base class
public abstract class Shape
{
    public abstract void Draw();
}

// Interface
public interface IResizable
{
    void Resize(int width, int height);
}

// Derived class inheriting from Shape and implementing IResizable
public class Rectangle : Shape, IResizable
{
    public override void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a rectangle.");
    }

    public void Resize(int width, int height)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Resizing the rectangle to {width}x{height}.");
    }
}

// Usage
Rectangle rect = new Rectangle();
rect.Draw(); // Output: Drawing a rectangle.
rect.Resize(100, 200); // Output: Resizing the rectangle to 100x200.
```

In this example, the `Rectangle` class inherits the `Draw` method from the `Shape` base class through implementation inheritance and implements the `Resize` method specified by the `IResizable` interface through interface inheritance.

Understanding both interface and implementation inheritance provides flexibility in designing and implementing object-oriented systems in C#.

## Explicit Interface Inheritance

In C#, explicit interface implementation allows a class to implement members of an interface explicitly, which means those members are only accessible through an instance of the interface.

Here's an example to demonstrate explicit interface implementation:

```csharp
using System;

// Define an interface
public interface IShape
{
    void Draw();
}

// Define a class implementing the interface
public class Rectangle : IShape
{
    // Explicitly implement the interface method
    void IShape.Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing a rectangle.");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create an instance of Rectangle
        Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle();

        // Access the Draw method through the interface reference
        ((IShape)rectangle).Draw(); // Output: Drawing a rectangle.
    }
}
```

In the example above:

- We define an interface `IShape` with a method `Draw()`.
- We define a class `Rectangle` that implements the `IShape` interface.
- The `Rectangle` class explicitly implements the `Draw()` method of the `IShape` interface. This is done by prefixing the method with the interface name and a dot (`IShape.`).
- In the `Main` method, we create an instance of `Rectangle`.
- We then access the `Draw()` method through an interface reference `(IShape)rectangle`. This allows us to access the explicitly implemented method of the interface.

Explicit interface implementation is useful when a class implements multiple interfaces and there is a chance of method name collision. It also allows hiding interface methods that might not be intended for general use.


## Multiple Interface Inheritance

In C#, a class can inherit from multiple interfaces, allowing it to implement the contracts defined by those interfaces. This is known as multiple interface inheritance.

Here's an example:

```csharp
// Interface 1
public interface IDrawable
{
    void Draw();
}

// Interface 2
public interface IResizable
{
    void Resize(int width, int height);
}

// Class implementing both interfaces
public class Shape : IDrawable, IResizable
{
    public void Draw()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Drawing the shape.");
    }

    public void Resize(int width, int height)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Resizing the shape to {width}x{height}.");
    }
}

// Usage
Shape shape = new Shape();
shape.Draw(); // Output: Drawing the shape.
shape.Resize(100, 200); // Output: Resizing the shape to 100x200.
```

In this example, the `Shape` class implements both the `IDrawable` and `IResizable` interfaces, which means it must provide implementations for the methods defined in both interfaces (`Draw()` and `Resize()`). 

When a class implements multiple interfaces, it must provide implementations for all the members defined in each interface it inherits. This allows the class to exhibit behavior defined by multiple contracts, providing flexibility in code design and reuse.


## Multilevel  vs. Multiple Inheritance

In C#, there's no direct support for multiple inheritance, where a class inherits from more than one base class. However, C# supports multilevel inheritance, where a class can inherit from another class, which in turn can inherit from another class, forming a hierarchical relationship.

Let's clarify both concepts:

### Multilevel Inheritance:

Multilevel inheritance involves the inheritance of properties and behaviors from multiple levels of classes, forming a chain of inheritance.

```csharp
// Base class
public class Animal
{
    public void Eat()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal is eating.");
    }
}

// Derived class inheriting from Animal
public class Mammal : Animal
{
    public void Run()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Mammal is running.");
    }
}

// Derived class inheriting from Mammal
public class Dog : Mammal
{
    public void Bark()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog is barking.");
    }
}

// Usage
Dog dog = new Dog();
dog.Eat(); // Output: Animal is eating.
dog.Run(); // Output: Mammal is running.
dog.Bark(); // Output: Dog is barking.
```

In this example, the `Dog` class inherits from the `Mammal` class, which in turn inherits from the `Animal` class. This forms a multilevel inheritance hierarchy.

### Multiple Inheritance:

Multiple inheritance refers to a language feature where a class can inherit from more than one base class. However, C# does not support this directly due to issues like the diamond problem, where ambiguity can arise if the same member is inherited from multiple base classes.

```csharp
// Base class 1
public class A
{
    public void MethodA()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Method A");
    }
}

// Base class 2
public class B
{
    public void MethodB()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Method B");
    }
}

// Derived class inheriting from both A and B (this is not allowed in C#)
public class C : A, B
{
    // Attempting to inherit from multiple base classes would result in a compilation error.
}
```

In this example, attempting to create a class `C` that inherits from both `A` and `B` would result in a compilation error in C#.

While C# doesn't support multiple inheritance of classes, it does support multiple inheritance of interfaces, which allows a class to inherit from multiple interfaces as demonstrated in the previous response. This helps achieve similar benefits of multiple inheritance without the complications associated with inheriting implementation from multiple classes.
