# Garbage collection (GC)

Garbage collection (GC) in .NET is a mechanism by which the .NET runtime manages memory automatically. It tracks objects that are no longer in use and reclaims their memory, allowing the application to use memory efficiently without worrying about manual memory management. Here's how it generally works:

1. **Allocation**: When you create an object using the `new` keyword in .NET, memory is allocated from the managed heap for that object.

2. **Tracking References**: The runtime keeps track of all references to objects. If there are no active references to an object, it becomes eligible for garbage collection.

3. **Garbage Collection Process**: Periodically, or when the system determines that it's necessary, the garbage collector runs. It's a non-deterministic process and can occur at any time. During this process, the garbage collector identifies objects that are no longer reachable or in use.

4. **Mark and Sweep**: The GC traverses through all reachable objects starting from the root objects (like global variables, local variables, and static variables), marking them as live. Then, it sweeps through the heap, reclaiming memory from the objects that were not marked as live. Any objects with no live references are considered garbage and are subject to collection.

5. **Compact**: In some cases, the GC might perform a compaction step after reclaiming memory. This helps in reducing fragmentation in the heap and improving memory locality, which can lead to better performance.

.NET provides a managed environment, meaning developers don't explicitly free memory as in languages like C or C++. Instead, the garbage collector handles memory deallocation. However, developers can influence the garbage collection process by calling `GC.Collect()` to suggest to the runtime that a garbage collection should occur. Though, it's generally not recommended to force garbage collection, as it can interfere with the runtime's optimizations.

It's important to understand how garbage collection works in .NET when designing applications to ensure efficient memory usage and avoid common pitfalls like memory leaks or performance issues related to excessive garbage collection.
