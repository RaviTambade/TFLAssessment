Manual testing involves the manual execution of test cases without the use of automation tools or scripts. Testers interact directly with the software application to verify its functionality, usability, and user experience. Let's illustrate manual testing using a scenario involving an e-commerce application:

**Scenario**: Suppose you're testing the checkout process of an e-commerce application.

**Manual Testing Test Cases**:

1. **Adding Items to Cart**:
   - Test case: Verify that users can add items to their shopping cart.
   - Scenario: Open the e-commerce website, navigate to a product category, select a product, and click the "Add to Cart" button. Verify that the selected item is added to the shopping cart and the cart subtotal is updated accordingly.

2. **Updating Cart Quantity**:
   - Test case: Verify that users can update the quantity of items in their shopping cart.
   - Scenario: Open the shopping cart page, locate an item in the cart, update the quantity field, and click the "Update" button. Verify that the cart subtotal is updated based on the new quantity.

3. **Removing Items from Cart**:
   - Test case: Verify that users can remove items from their shopping cart.
   - Scenario: Open the shopping cart page, locate an item in the cart, and click the "Remove" or "Delete" button. Verify that the item is removed from the cart, and the cart subtotal is updated accordingly.

4. **Proceeding to Checkout**:
   - Test case: Verify that users can proceed to the checkout process.
   - Scenario: Click the "Checkout" button in the shopping cart, enter shipping and billing information in the checkout form, and click the "Place Order" button. Verify that the order is processed successfully, and the user receives a confirmation message or email.

5. **Validating Order Confirmation**:
   - Test case: Verify that users receive a confirmation of their order after completing the checkout process.
   - Scenario: Complete the checkout process as a registered user or guest, and verify that an order confirmation page is displayed with details of the order, including order number, items purchased, and shipping information.

**Execution and Reporting**:

- Manually execute each test case by following the specified scenarios and interacting with the e-commerce application.
- Record the test results, including any observed behavior, errors, or discrepancies encountered during testing.
- If any test cases fail, investigate the failures to identify the root cause and document any defects or issues found.
- Report the manual testing results, including test coverage and any identified defects, to the development team for resolution.

Manual testing provides several benefits, including:

- Flexibility to explore the application's functionality and user interface.
- Ability to perform ad-hoc testing and identify edge cases not covered by automated tests.
- Evaluation of the user experience and usability of the application from an end-user perspective.
- Early detection of visual defects, layout issues, and inconsistencies in the application's appearance.

However, manual testing also has limitations, such as being time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale for repetitive or complex test scenarios. As a result, organizations often complement manual testing with automation testing to achieve better test coverage, efficiency, and reliability in their testing efforts.
