# White-box testing

White-box testing, also known as structural testing or clear box testing, is a software testing technique where the internal structure, design, and implementation details of a software application are examined. Test cases are derived from an understanding of the code's logic, paths, and data flows. The primary goal of white-box testing is to ensure that all branches, statements, and paths within the code are executed and verified.

Let's illustrate white-box testing using a scenario:

**Scenario**: Suppose you're developing a simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**White-box Test Cases**:

1. **Addition Function**:
   - Test case: Verify that the addition function correctly adds two numbers.
   - Scenario: Provide two positive numbers as input and verify that the result is the sum of the two numbers.
   - Additional test case: Provide a positive number and a negative number as input and verify the result.

2. **Subtraction Function**:
   - Test case: Verify that the subtraction function correctly subtracts one number from another.
   - Scenario: Provide two positive numbers as input and verify that the result is the difference between the two numbers.
   - Additional test case: Provide a negative number as the second operand and verify the result.

3. **Multiplication Function**:
   - Test case: Verify that the multiplication function correctly multiplies two numbers.
   - Scenario: Provide two positive numbers as input and verify that the result is the product of the two numbers.
   - Additional test case: Provide zero as one of the operands and verify that the result is zero.

4. **Division Function**:
   - Test case: Verify that the division function correctly divides one number by another.
   - Scenario: Provide two positive numbers as input and verify that the result is the quotient of the division.
   - Additional test case: Provide zero as the divisor and verify that an appropriate error or exception is raised.

**Execution and Reporting**:

- Develop test cases for each function based on an understanding of the code's logic and implementation details.
- Implement unit tests using a white-box testing framework such as NUnit or MSTest.
- Execute the unit tests against the calculator application's code.
- Verify that all test cases pass without any failures or errors.
- If any test cases fail, investigate the failures to identify the root cause and fix any defects or issues found.
- Document the white-box testing results, including test coverage metrics and any defects found, to ensure proper tracking and communication with the development team.

White-box testing helps ensure the correctness and robustness of the calculator application's code by thoroughly examining its internal logic and paths. By validating each function's behavior under various scenarios and inputs, white-box testing helps identify and address potential issues early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software.
