# Regression Testing
Regression testing is a type of software testing that ensures that recent changes or modifications to a software application haven't adversely affected existing functionalities. It involves re-running previously executed test cases to verify that the existing features still work correctly after new code changes, bug fixes, or enhancements have been implemented. The goal of regression testing is to catch any regressions or unintended side effects introduced by the changes and ensure the overall stability and reliability of the software.

Let's illustrate regression testing using a scenario:

**Scenario**: Suppose you're developing a web-based e-commerce platform where users can browse products, add them to their shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. After making some updates to the product browsing functionality, you want to ensure that existing features, such as adding products to the cart and checking out, still work as expected.

**Regression Test Cases**:

1. **Browse Products**:
   - Test case: Verify that users can browse products and view product details.
   - Scenario: Navigate to the product catalog, click on various product listings, and ensure that product details are displayed correctly.

2. **Add Product to Cart**:
   - Test case: Ensure that users can add products to their shopping cart.
   - Scenario: Select different products from the catalog, click on the "Add to Cart" button, and verify that the selected products are added to the shopping cart.

3. **Remove Product from Cart**:
   - Test case: Verify that users can remove products from their shopping cart.
   - Scenario: Add products to the shopping cart, navigate to the cart page, and click on the "Remove" button next to selected products. Verify that the products are removed from the cart.

4. **Proceed to Checkout**:
   - Test case: Ensure that users can proceed to checkout from the shopping cart.
   - Scenario: Add products to the shopping cart, navigate to the cart page, and click on the "Proceed to Checkout" button. Verify that users are redirected to the checkout page without errors.

5. **Complete Checkout Process**:
   - Test case: Verify that users can complete the checkout process and place an order.
   - Scenario: Proceed to the checkout page, enter shipping and billing information, select a payment method, and complete the checkout process. Verify that the order is successfully placed, and a confirmation message is displayed.

**Execution and Reporting**:

- After making updates to the product browsing functionality, execute the regression test suite, which includes all the previously mentioned test cases.
- Verify that all test cases pass without any failures or regressions, indicating that the existing features are still functioning correctly.
- If any test cases fail, investigate the failures to determine whether they are caused by the recent changes or existing issues. Fix any defects or issues identified during regression testing.
- Document the regression testing results, including any issues found, their root causes, and resolutions, to ensure proper tracking and communication with the development team.

Regression testing helps maintain the stability and reliability of the e-commerce platform by ensuring that existing functionalities remain intact after making changes or updates. By regularly performing regression testing, you can catch any regressions early in the development process, minimize the risk of introducing new defects, and deliver a high-quality software product to users.
