# Black-box testing
Black-box testing is a software testing technique where the internal workings of the software application are not known to the tester. Instead, testers focus on validating the functionality and behavior of the software based on its specifications, requirements, and inputs. The goal of black-box testing is to ensure that the software meets its intended functionality and behaves correctly from the end-user's perspective, without needing knowledge of its internal implementation.

Let's illustrate black-box testing using a scenario:

**Scenario**: Suppose you're testing a login page for a web application.

**Black-box Test Cases**:

1. **Valid Credentials**:
   - Test case: Verify that users can log in successfully with valid credentials.
   - Scenario: Enter a valid username and password combination and verify that the user is logged in and redirected to the dashboard or home page.

2. **Invalid Username**:
   - Test case: Verify the system's response when the user enters an invalid username.
   - Scenario: Enter a non-existent username with a valid password and verify that the system displays an error message indicating that the username is incorrect.

3. **Invalid Password**:
   - Test case: Verify the system's response when the user enters an invalid password.
   - Scenario: Enter a valid username with an incorrect password and verify that the system displays an error message indicating that the password is incorrect.

4. **Blank Username and Password**:
   - Test case: Verify the system's response when the user submits the login form with blank username and password fields.
   - Scenario: Leave both the username and password fields blank and verify that the system displays an error message indicating that both fields are required.

5. **Remember Me Functionality**:
   - Test case: Verify that the "Remember Me" functionality works as expected.
   - Scenario: Log in with valid credentials and enable the "Remember Me" option. Close the browser and reopen it, then navigate to the login page. Verify that the user is automatically logged in without having to re-enter credentials.

**Execution and Reporting**:

- Develop test cases based on the application's specifications, requirements, and user scenarios.
- Implement automated or manual tests to execute the black-box test cases against the login page.
- Execute the test cases and record the results, including any observed behavior, errors, or discrepancies.
- If any test cases fail, investigate the failures to identify the root cause and document any defects or issues found.
- Report the black-box testing results, including test coverage and any identified defects, to the development team for resolution.

Black-box testing allows testers to validate the functionality and behavior of the software application without needing knowledge of its internal implementation details. By focusing on the application's external interfaces and user interactions, black-box testing helps ensure that the software meets its requirements and delivers a satisfactory user experience.
