# Test Driven Development (TDD


Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process where tests are written before the actual code. These tests define the expected behavior of the system. Developers then write code to pass these tests, ensuring that the code meets the specified requirements. This iterative cycle continues throughout the development process, with tests being continuously added or modified as the code evolves. TDD aims to improve code quality, maintainability, and reliability by catching defects early in the development process.

.NET Core is an open-source, cross-platform framework for building various types of applications, including web, desktop, and mobile applications. It provides a runtime, libraries, and tools for building and running .NET applications on different platforms, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.

When you combine Test Driven Development with .NET Core, you're essentially applying the principles of TDD to develop .NET Core applications. This means writing unit tests using a testing framework like MSTest, xUnit, or NUnit, and then writing code to pass those tests using .NET Core. This approach ensures that your .NET Core applications are thoroughly tested and meet the specified requirements from the beginning of the development process. Additionally, .NET Core's cross-platform capabilities allow you to develop and run these tests on different operating systems, providing flexibility and ensuring the reliability of your applications across various environments.


Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual implementation code. These tests specify and validate the expected behavior of the system. Developers then write code to make these tests pass. This iterative cycle continues, with developers writing new tests for new features or modifying existing tests to accommodate changes, and then writing code to pass those tests. TDD aims to improve code quality, maintainability, and reliability by catching defects early in the development process.

When you mention a "scenario + assessment application" in the context of TDD, it likely refers to a software application designed to present users with scenarios or questions and assess their responses. Such applications could be educational tools, training platforms, or evaluation systems used in various domains like education, recruitment, or employee training.

Applying TDD to the development of a scenario + assessment application involves following these general steps:

1. **Write Tests**: Developers start by writing tests that define the expected behavior of the application. These tests could include scenarios related to user interactions, input validation, data processing, or any other aspect relevant to the application's functionality.

2. **Run Tests (and Watch Them Fail)**: Initially, all the tests should fail because there's no implementation code yet. Running the tests at this stage helps ensure that they are correctly configured and are genuinely testing the desired behavior.

3. **Write Code to Pass Tests**: Developers then write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the tests pass. This code should meet the requirements specified by the tests but may not be the final implementation.

4. **Refactor Code**: Once the tests pass, developers refactor the code to improve its design, readability, and maintainability while ensuring that all tests continue to pass.

5. **Repeat**: Developers continue this cycle, writing new tests for new features or modifications, and then writing code to pass those tests, ensuring that the application evolves incrementally and remains thoroughly tested.

By following TDD principles, developers ensure that the scenario + assessment application meets the specified requirements, remains robust against changes, and maintains a high level of code quality throughout its development lifecycle. Additionally, the suite of tests serves as documentation for the application's behavior and helps detect regressions when making changes in the future.


## Test Driven Development (TDD) Step by Step

Let's walk through an example of Test Driven Development (TDD) applied to a simple scenario using .NET Core. Suppose we're building a basic calculator application with functionalities for addition and subtraction. We'll use xUnit as the testing framework.

1. **Write the First Test**:
   
   We'll start by writing a test for the addition functionality. Create a new .NET Core project and add a test class for the calculator.

   ```csharp
   
   using Xunit;

   namespace Calculator.Tests
   {
       public class CalculatorTests
       {
           [Fact]
           public void Add_TwoNumbers_ReturnsCorrectResult()
           {
               // Arrange
               var calculator = new Calculator();

               // Act
               var result = calculator.Add(3, 4);

               // Assert
               Assert.Equal(7, result);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Run the Test**:

   Since we haven't implemented the `Calculator` class yet, this test will fail.

3. **Write Code to Pass the Test**:

   Implement the `Calculator` class with the `Add` method.

   ```csharp
   namespace Calculator
   {
       public class Calculator
       {
           public int Add(int a, int b)
           {
               return a + b;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Run the Test Again**:

   Now, the test should pass.

5. **Write Additional Tests**:

   Let's add another test for the subtraction functionality.

   ```csharp
   [Fact]
   public void Subtract_TwoNumbers_ReturnsCorrectResult()
   {
       // Arrange
       var calculator = new Calculator();

       // Act
       var result = calculator.Subtract(10, 4);

       // Assert
       Assert.Equal(6, result);
   }
   ```

6. **Run Tests and Implement the Code**:

   Implement the `Subtract` method in the `Calculator` class.

   ```csharp
   public int Subtract(int a, int b)
   {
       return a - b;
   }
   ```

7. **Refactor and Repeat**:

   Refactor the code as needed and continue adding more tests and functionality, following the TDD cycle.

By following this process, you ensure that your code is always tested and functional, and any changes you make won't break existing functionality. TDD encourages better design, more maintainable code, and increased confidence in the correctness of your software.
