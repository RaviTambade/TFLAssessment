# Functional Testing
Functional testing is a type of software testing that focuses on verifying that a software application performs its functions or features correctly according to the specified requirements. It involves testing the application's user interface, APIs, databases, and other components to ensure that they behave as expected and meet the intended functionality.

Let's illustrate functional testing using a scenario:

**Scenario**: Imagine you are developing an e-commerce website where users can browse products, add them to their shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. Functional testing ensures that all these features work as intended.

**Functional Test Cases**:

1. **Browse Products**:
   - Test case: Verify that users can view the list of available products on the website.
   - Steps:
     1. Open the website's homepage.
     2. Navigate to the "Products" or "Shop" section.
     3. Verify that a list of products is displayed.

2. **Add Product to Cart**:
   - Test case: Verify that users can add a product to their shopping cart.
   - Steps:
     1. Browse products and select a product.
     2. Click on the "Add to Cart" button.
     3. Navigate to the shopping cart page.
     4. Verify that the selected product is added to the cart.

3. **Remove Product from Cart**:
   - Test case: Verify that users can remove a product from their shopping cart.
   - Steps:
     1. Add a product to the shopping cart.
     2. Navigate to the shopping cart page.
     3. Click on the "Remove" or "Delete" button next to the product.
     4. Verify that the product is removed from the cart.

4. **Proceed to Checkout**:
   - Test case: Verify that users can proceed to checkout from the shopping cart.
   - Steps:
     1. Add a product to the shopping cart.
     2. Navigate to the shopping cart page.
     3. Click on the "Proceed to Checkout" button.
     4. Verify that the user is redirected to the checkout page.

5. **Complete Checkout Process**:
   - Test case: Verify that users can complete the checkout process and place an order.
   - Steps:
     1. Proceed to the checkout page.
     2. Enter shipping and billing information.
     3. Select a payment method and enter payment details.
     4. Click on the "Place Order" button.
     5. Verify that the order is successfully placed, and a confirmation message is displayed.

**Execution and Reporting**:

- Testers execute each test case, following the specified steps and verifying the expected outcomes.
- If any test case fails, testers report the defects to the development team, including detailed information such as steps to reproduce, screenshots, and logs.
- Developers then analyze the reported defects and work on fixing them.
- Once all test cases pass successfully, the e-commerce website is considered ready for deployment.

Functional testing ensures that the e-commerce website's features work correctly and provide a seamless shopping experience for users. It helps identify defects early in the development process, ensuring the quality and reliability of the software application.
